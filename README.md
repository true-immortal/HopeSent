# HopeSent
- An AI-Driven Sentiment Analysis and Support System.

The core idea of this project is to develop a web application that utilizes Azure AI and related Azure services to screen individuals for the risk of developing mental disorders. The application aims to provide a quick, efficient, and user-friendly platform for both the general public and frontline health workers to self-identify mental health status and receive guidance for support.

Key Features:

- Self-Identification and Screening:
Screening tools integrated into the application include well-known questionnaires such as PHQ-9, GAD-7, and others.

- AI-Powered Analysis:
Azure Cognitive Services and Machine Learning models analyze the responses to provide a risk assessment.

- Guidance for Support:
The application provides immediate guidance on steps to take based on the screening results.

# Note
- While the home page of the application is hosted through Azure Static Web Apps, other components, including the HealthBot, benefit from Azure's infrastructure.
(I was unable to deploy the complete web app using azure as azure web app  had some technical issues as stated by microsoft suppport for the Azure Student Subscription. )

- This Project is developed by Kalla Sri Satya using Azure Services for the purpose of Microsoft Future Ready Talent Internship 2024.

- The FAQ and contact us are not yet completely deployed (Apologies for the inconvenience).
