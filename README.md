AI-Driven Sentiment Analysis and Support System for Orphans 

The core idea of this project is to develop a web application that utilizes Azure AI and related Azure services to screen individuals for the risk of developing mental disorders. The application aims to provide a quick, efficient, and user-friendly platform for both the general public and frontline health workers to self-identify mental health status and receive guidance for support.

Problem Statement:

Mental health disorders are a significant burden on the healthcare system in India, as evidenced by the National Mental Health Survey-2016. Early identification and intervention are crucial to managing and mitigating these disorders. However, the current tools for screening mental health risks face several challenges:

1.Lack of ready availability and accessibility.

2.Difficulty in interpreting results.

3.Lack of immediate guidance and action based on the screening results.

4.Limited use by frontline health workers due to complexity and time constraints.


Key Features:

Self-Identification and Screening:
Users can self-identify their mental health status by answering a series of validated questions.
Screening tools integrated into the application include well-known questionnaires such as PHQ-9, GAD-7, and others.

AI-Powered Analysis:
Azure Cognitive Services and Machine Learning models analyze the responses to provide a risk assessment.
Personalized feedback and recommendations are generated based on the analysis.

Guidance for Support:
The application provides immediate guidance on steps to take based on the screening results.
Recommendations include lifestyle changes, seeking professional help, and resources for further reading.
